# mafia - work in a team, they can kill somebody or corrupt the narrator
# inspector - asks to discover the identity of a player (and on which side he is), gets wrong clues if the narrator was corrupted
# hooker - sleeps with somebody, that person cannot do anything during the night, if the mafia kills the client the hooker dies too, one turn after the act the client has AIDS and dies a turn later if he is not cured
# doctor - cures AIDS
# bodyguard - protects somebody during the night
# joker - wins if he gets lynched with a strict majority vote (50%+1)
# wanderer - every night, he is informed of the actions of a player
# opportunist - can ask to know who has a given role and can switch sides anytime
# vigilante - gets the inspector's information and can kill somebody during the night


# things to do list: ghost, joker, twins, !kill hooker instead of regular, lovers, martyr, assassin. maybe: cab driver, party dude, fallguy, mole.
# ghost: villager becomes randomly. immune to killing and votes. acts as hooker at night. mindfuck role DONE.
# joker: same villager becomes randomly. lone psychopath. DONE
# twins: seperate faction. one dies by mafia, other becomes vigilante. one dies by lynch, becomes lone psychopath. DONE
# !kill hooker means to change to respond only to guy who does !kill DONE.
# lovers is just a team change for two people randomly. old powers remain, just on a different side.
# martyr is weak hooker. when fucks someone, becomes their target. DONE.
# assassin is a good vigilante. when mayor dies becomes loner/mafia.
# cab driver switches around two peoples results. switches what happens to them not what they do.
# party dude throws party
# mole/fallguy obv.
# johnny tightlips: silencer. DONE

#Most roles added by internet (pinkmoth) to my knowledge. Conversion to Python 3 by penguin344. Idea for choose your own role from billymills, implemented by penguin344.
